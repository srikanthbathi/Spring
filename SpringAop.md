AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code without modification of the code itself. Instead, we declare separately which code is to modify.

**AspectJ** 
implements both concerns and the weaving of crosscutting concerns using extensions of Java programming language.
