SPRING IOC Container -- [Inversion of control is nothing but outsourcing the creation, managing and configuring the objects.]

The spring container is the core of Spring framework. This container creates the objects, wire them together and manage their complete life cycle. The Primary function of the IOC Container is to create and manage POJO's by means of DI(Dependency injection) 

Dependency Injection-- [DI is a design pattern which enables the computer program developers to implement loosely coupled code by injecting objects to classes in spite of creating objects inside a class. This gives the code which is loosely coupled maintainable and testable.]

Bean - A POJO that is created, managed and configured by spring container is refered as spring bean.
